Postfix++ Calculator
Overview
The Postfix++ Calculator is a stack-based interpreter written in JavaScript that evaluates arithmetic expressions written in postfix notation. Extending traditional postfix evaluation, Postfix++ supports variable assignments, allowing users to define and reuse variables within expressions.

Features
Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic arithmetic operations including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Postfix Expression Evaluation: Uses a stack to process expressions in postfix notation.
Variable Assignment: Allows users to assign values to variables using the '=' operator (e.g., "A 3 =" assigns the value 3 to variable A).
Error Handling: Includes basic error detection for common issues such as insufficient operands or division by zero.
How It Works
Token Parsing:

The input expression is split into tokens, which can be numbers, operators, or variable names.
Stack-Based Evaluation:

Operands: Numbers (or variable values) are pushed onto the stack.
Operators: When an operator is encountered, the necessary operands are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back.
Variable Assignment: The assignment operator (=) pops the variable name and the value from the stack and stores the value in a variable dictionary.
Final Result:

After processing all tokens, the result of the expression is the value at the top of the stack.
Getting Started
Prerequisites:

A modern web browser (if running in a browser environment)
Node.js (if running the project locally using Node.js)
Installation and Usage:

Clone the Repository: git clone <repository-url> cd postfix-calculator

Run in Node.js: node calculator.js

Or Use in the Browser: Open the index.html file in your favorite browser to start using the calculator interactively.

Example Usage:

Simple Arithmetic: Input: 3 4 + Output: 7

Using Variables: Input: A 3 = (This assigns the value 3 to variable A)

Input: A 4 + Output: 7
